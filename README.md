# Java Tasks

In this file, there are a bunch of Java mini tasks (taken from a variety of online coding tests or personal ideas). They offer different Java skills, showcased to demonstrate a range of fetaures that Java has to offer. For every task there is a description for it in this ReadME file. The point of this repository is to enhance existing skills, tackle new challenges and use Java to solve a variety of problems.
For every project, comments are written in order to allow the user to understand the use of each and learn from my code.
